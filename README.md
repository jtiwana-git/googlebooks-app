# Googlebooks-App

## Description

The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

This project is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

## User Story
```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```
