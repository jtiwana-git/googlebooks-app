Queries and mutations (CLIENT SIDE)

Recode API.js

SavedBooks.js:

Remove the useEffect() Hook that sets the state for UserData.

Instead, use the useQuery() Hook to execute the GET_ME query on load and save it to a variable named userData.

Use the useMutation() Hook to execute the REMOVE_BOOK mutation in the handleDeleteBook() function instead of the deleteBook() function that's imported from API file. (Make sure you keep the removeBookId() function in place!)
